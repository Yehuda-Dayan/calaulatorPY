RELIABILITY: Input validation via argparse ensures correct data types, with clear handling of errors like division by zero.
MAINTAINABILITY: Modular code design allows easy updates and separation of logic, parsing, and output.
SCALABILITY: Easily extendable with new operations or interfaces (e.g., REST API, GUI), and fits well into automated workflows or larger systems.
